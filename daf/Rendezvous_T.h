    /** @class Rendezvous
    *@brief Specialised Barrier class
    *
    * A rendezvous is a barrier that:
    * <ul>
    *   <li> Unlike a CyclicBarrier, is not restricted to use
    *     with fixed-sized groups of threads.
    *     Any number of threads can attempt to enter a rendezvous,
    *     but only the predetermined number of parties enter
    *     and later become released from the rendezvous at any give time.
    *   <li> Enables each participating thread to exchange information
    *     with others at the rendezvous point. Each entering thread
    *     presents some object on entry to the rendezvous, and
    *     returns some object on release. The object returned is
    *     the result of a RendezvousFunction that is run once per
    *     rendezvous, (it is run by the last-entering thread). By
    *     default, the function applied is a rotation, so each
    *     thread returns the object given by the next (modulo parties)
    *     entering thread. This default function faciliates simple
    *     application of a common use of rendezvous, as exchangers.
    * </ul>
    * <p>
    * Rendezvous use an all-or-none breakage model
    * for failed synchronization attempts: If threads
    * leave a rendezvous point prematurely because of timeout
    * or interruption, others will also leave abnormally
    * (via BrokenBarrierException), until
    * the rendezvous is <code>restart</code>ed. This is usually
    * the simplest and best strategy for sharing knowledge
    * about failures among cooperating threads in the most
    * common usages contexts of Rendezvous.
    * <p>
    * While any positive number (including 1) of parties can
    * be handled, the most common case is to have two parties.
