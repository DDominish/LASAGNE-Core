/*
    BEWARE:  Changed filename to 0_DAFInit.cpp to ensure first in linkage order under VC
    The anonymous namespace below defines a number of Global Variable "Loaders".
    Some items to be aware of are:
    - Runtime Global Variable creation and initialisation is dependent on the dynamic Loader's
      order of the Shared Library load.
    - Runtime Global Variable creation and initialisation within a shared library is dependent on the Compiler/Linker's object
      linking order. Some are alphabetical (VC), some are order of declaration, some are configurable.
    - The order of declaration of Global Variables inside OS.cpp is important in terms of dependency between
      global variables. ie ACE::init -> DAF_Loader (Reactor) -> ....
    - Any future development that makes use of global variables should consider whether
      they should be placed inside OS.cpp to maintain the correct link and load order for DAF. Or consider some other form
      of initialisation. For example, static declaration within a function or using a singleton, which are
      initialised on first usage.

                The system automatically fixes memory alignment faults and makes them invisible to the application.
                It does this for the calling process and any descendant processes.This feature is only supported by certain processor architectures.
                For more information, see the Remarks section.

                SEM_NOOPENFILEERRORBOX
                The system does not display a message box when it fails to find a file.Instead, the error is returned to the calling process.
