/******************  CountDownSemaphore ************************
* A CountDownSemaphore can serve as a simple one-shot
* barrier that is initialized with a given count value.
*
* Each release decrements the count.
* All acquires block until the count reaches zero. Upon reaching
* zero all current acquires are unblocked and all
* subsequent acquires pass without blocking. This is a one-shot
* phenomenon -- the count cannot be reset.
* If you need a version that resets the count, consider
* using a CyclicBarrier.
