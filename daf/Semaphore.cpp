#define DAF_SEMAPHORE_CPP

/**********************  Semaphore *****************************
* Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of permits.
* Each acquire() blocks if necessary
* until a permit is available, and then takes it.
* Each release adds a permit. However, no actual permit objects
* are used; the Semaphore just keeps a count of the number
* available and acts accordingly.
* <p>
* A semaphore seed initialized to 1 can serve as a mutual
* exclusion lock. Negative seeds are also allowed, in which
* case no acquires will proceed until the number of releases
* has pushed the number of permits past 0.
* <p>
* Different implementation subclasses may provide different
* ordering guarantees (or lack thereof) surrounding which
* threads will be resumed upon a signal.
* <p>
* The default implementation makes NO
* guarantees about the order in which threads will
* acquire permits. It is often faster than other implementations.
